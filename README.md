# OthelloNet
My computer science bachelor project called OthelloNet. The primary goal of this project has been to design and implement a network version of the game Othello in Java. From the beginning, this project has been using a preexisting network version of Othello dating from 1996. The aforementioned version of Othello, entitled NetOthello, has been instrumental in the process of specifying the functional requirements for the final prototype of this project, OthelloNet. The aim of this report has been to describe and documents the development process of OthelloNet. The main focus of this report has more precisely been to document how the overall design- and network structure has come to be through the description of the theories used and their relevant alternatives. By the end of this project it could be concluded that the final prototype, OthelloNet, fulfills the requirements stated although with a few exceptions.
