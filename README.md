## Description
My computer science bachelor project called OthelloNet. The primary goal of this project was to design and implement a network version of the game Othello in Java SE 7. From the beginning, this project has been using a preexisting network version of Othello dating from 1996. The aforementioned version of Othello, entitled NetOthello, has been instrumental in the process of specifying the functional requirements for the final prototype of this project, OthelloNet.

Features:

- Choose a color: either black or white
- Play over a local network
- Chat with your opponent while playing
